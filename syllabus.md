## Course Description

This course will provide students with the knowledge and tools to turn data into meaningful insights and stories. Focusing on the latest Python software tools, the course will outline the “pipeline” approach to data science. It will teach students the tools to gather, store, and analyze datasets, as well as the visualization techniques to both explore the data and transform results into understandable and accessible narratives. The course is organized into five main sections:

1. **Exploratory Data Science**: Students will be introduced to the main tools needed to get started analyzing and visualizing data using Python
1. **Geospatial Data Science**: Building on the previous set of tools, this module will teach students how to work with and extract insights from geospatial datasets using a range of modern Python toolkits
1. **Getting and Storing Data**: Students will learn how to collect new data through web scraping and APIs and store these datasets locally for efficient retrieval and analysis.
1. **Geospatial Data Science in the Wild**: Armed with the necessary data science tools, students will be introduced to a range of advanced analytic techniques using a number of innovative examples from modern researchers.
1. **From Exploration to Storytelling**: The final module will teach students to present their analysis results using web-based formats to transform their insights into interactive stories.

## Format

The course will be conducted in weekly sessions devoted to lectures, interactive demonstrations, and in-class projects.

## Assignments

There is one required final project at the end of the semester. Each of the five modules will cover several weeks and there will be roughly one homework assigned per module. Assignments will be assigned at the start of each module and due at the start of the following module.

For the final project, students will replicate the pipeline approach on a dataset (or datasets) of their choosing. The final deliverable will be a web-based data visualization and accompanying description including a summary of the results and the methods used in each step of the process (collection, storage, analysis and visualization).

## Grading

The grading breakdown is as follows: 50% for homework; 40% for final project, 10% for participation

There will be five required homework assignments, due at the beginning of class. Late homework will be accepted for up to one week after the deadline and will be deducted 10%. Credit will not be given for homework that is late by more than one week.

## Software

This course relies on use of Python and various related packages and for geospatial topics, we will also use QGIS and PostGIS. All software is open-source and freely available.

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to be familiar with and comply with Penn’s Code of Academic Integrity, which is available in the Pennbook, or online at https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity.
