## Recommended Python tutorials

The [The Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is a free, online textbook covering the Python basics needed in this course. In particular, the first four chapters are excellent:

- [Chapter 1: IPython/Jupyter](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.00-ipython-beyond-normal-python.html)
- [Chapter 2: Numpy](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/02.00-introduction-to-numpy.html)
- [Chapter 3: Pandas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html)
- [Chapter 4: matplotlib](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.00-introduction-to-matplotlib.html)

Note that you can click on the "Open in Colab" button for each chapter and run the examples interactively using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).

There are also a few good resources from the Berkeley Data Science Institute:
